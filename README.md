# stock-analysis
Green stocks analysis

# first VBA progam
Display a message box pop up

# using Range() and Cells()
Use Range() to determine the "title"
Use Cells() to add names to different columns

# using Loops() and Conditionals
Use for loop to sum totalVolume
Use conditionals if-then to search for the ticket "DQ" to increase the sum variable by a value

# re-using code
Our new macro should do the following:

  1. Format the output sheet on the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet.
  2. Initialize an array of all tickers.
  3. Prepare for the analysis of tickers.
    a. Initialize variables for the starting price and ending price.
    b. Activate the data worksheet.
    c. Find the number of rows to loop over.
  4. Loop through the tickers.
  5. Loop through rows in the data.
    a. Find the total volume for the current ticker.
    b. Find the starting price for the current ticker.
    c. Find the ending price for the current ticker.
  6. Output the data for the current ticker.

# Using Conditional formatting
Conditionally format all the cells with a loop.

# Running Analysys for Any Year
Using bottons to run the analysis for any year

# Measuring Code Performance
Using the Timer function in VBA to display the time it takes to the code to make the analysys
Finally create a message box statement to show the elapsed time
